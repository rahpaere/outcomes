Computer Engineering Technology B.S.
Mission
The mission of the Computer Engineering Technology (CET) bachelor's degree program in the Computer Systems Engineering Technology (CSET) Department at Oregon Institute of Technology is to provide an excellent education incorporating industry-relevant, applied laboratory based design and analysis to our students. The program is to serve a constituency consisting of its alumni, employers in the high-technology industry, and the members of our Industrial Advisory Board. Major components of the CET program's mission in the CSET Department are to:

educate computer engineering technology students to meet current and future industrial challenges,
promote a sense of scholarship, leadership, and professional service among our graduates,
enable our students to create, develop, and disseminate knowledge for the applied engineering environment,
expose our students to cross-disciplinary educational programs, and
provide high tech industry employers with graduates in the computer engineering technology profession, a profession which is increasingly being driven by advances in technology.
Program Educational Objectives
Alumni of the Computer Engineering Technology (CET) bachelor's degree program may be employed in a wide range of high tech industries from industrial manufacturing to consumer electronics where they will be involved in solving problems through the development of hardware, software and embedded applications. Alumni may be involved in product design, testing and qualification, application engineering, customer support, sales, or public relations.

Alumni will demonstrate technical competency through success in computer engineering technology positions and/or pursuit of engineering or engineering technology graduate studies if desired.
Alumni will demonstrate competencies in communication and teamwork skills by assuming increasing levels of responsibility and/or leadership or managerial roles.
Alumni will develop professionally, pursue continued learning and practice responsibly and ethically.
Expected Student Learning Outcomes
Graduates of the CET bachelor's degree program are expected to be able to demonstrate:

an ability to select and apply the knowledge, techniques, skills, and modern tools of the discipline to broadly-defined engineering technology activities;
an ability to select and apply a knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to engineering technology problems that require the application of principles and applied procedures or methodologies;
an ability to conduct standard tests and measurements; to conduct, analyze, and interpret experiments; and to apply experimental results to improve processes;
an ability to design systems, components, or processes for broadly-defined engineering technology problems appropriate to program educational objectives;
an ability to function effectively as a member or leader on a technical team;
an ability to identify, analyze, and solve broadly-defined engineering technology problems;
an ability to apply written, oral, and graphical communication in both technical and non-technical environments; and an ability to identify and use appropriate technical literature;
an understanding of the need for and an ability to engage in self-directed continuing professional development;
an understanding of and a commitment to address professional and ethical responsibilities including a respect for diversity;
a knowledge of the impact of engineering technology solutions in a societal and global context; and
a commitment to quality, timeliness, and continuous improvement.
