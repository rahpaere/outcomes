I also wanted to follow up on our transfer table. You seem to be overloading some of our course numbers, so I don’t think there will be an exact number-to-number transfer. For instance, your CS162 doesn’t really transfer to anything we have, so rather than transferring in as our CS162, it would transfer in as a lower division CS elective. Your CS163 looks to be similar to our CS163 and your CS260 is probably similar to our CS202 (though the other community colleges in the Oregon list CS260 as their data structure class that is transferred in as our CS163 and CS261 as our CS202). Your CS271 is similar to our CS201.
 
Students transferring to PSU from other schools (including CGCC) will be required to pass our Programming Proficiency exam before being admitted to the upper division program.  Our programming proficiency demo is done in C++ using the Linux command line. If you are using Java as the final programming language, make sure that students transferring to PSU are refreshed in C++ before they finish everything up.
 
If you can get me syllabi, I can start working on the transfer table so you can use it for advising.
 
Also, in looking at your catalog, it appears that CGCC does not offer calculus based Physics. For students transferring to PSU, please advise them to take CS221/CH222/CH223 there is currently an automatic transfer arrangement between CGCC and PSU for the Chemistry sequence.
