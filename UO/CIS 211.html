<h4><b>The Point of the Course</b></h4>

<p>The objective of this course is to build on the basic    programming concepts and practices that you learned in CIS 210,    for you to continue your development as programmers and computer    scientists. The course is structured around a number of important    programming concepts, as follows: Problem decomposition,    structured programming, files manipulation, exceptions,    inheritance, object-oriented programming, namespaces and scope, testing and debugging,    and possibly event-driven programming and graphical-user interface programming. Though the topics will be    examined, discussed, and exercised primarily in the context of the    Python programming language, students in this class should develop a    general, abstract appreciation for these different concepts    independent of Python.</p>
<h4>Textbooks</h4>

<p>The course will draw from a number of authoritative text sources, including:</p>
<p>The official Python Documentation at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">https://docs.python.org/3/</a></p>
<p>Downey, A. B. (2012). Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. (Version 2.0.17.). Green Tree Press. Available in PDF form at <a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/">http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/</a></p>

<h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>

<h4>Reading</h4>
<p>You are expected to read the assigned reading before class. You are expected to take notes on what you read, understand the material, and to look up words that you don't know in a dictionary.</p>
<h4>Class Participation</h4>
<p>Students are expected to attend lectures and lab sessions, and to  take notes (handwritten  in lectures). Your in-class participation may be supplemented by emailing the instructor and GTFs with questions or comments, which they will try to incorporate into the next class.</p>
<p>Please come to class ready to engage the material and to interact face-to-face with the other human beings in the classroom. The class policy is that you should  power down and put away all electronic devices before class starts. Activities such as texting, surfing the web, or checking email during class is inappropriate, discourteous, and distracting to other students and the instructor. Please use lecture time to practice your skill of pondering.</p>
<h4>Attend Class</h4>
<p> You are expected to  maximize the teaching and learning opportunity by attending lectures and labs. You are expected to schedule other commitments to avoid conflicts with the course. The only acceptable excuses for missing a class are documented medical problems, religious holidays (if cleared in advance), attending  academic conferences (if cleared in advance), and documented personal emergencies. If you miss a class, you are expected to contact your classmates to  try to acquire the knowledge, guidance, and materials that you sadly missed  in that class.</p>
<p><strong>Computing Resources<br>
</strong></p>
<p>For this course, you are  expected to have   a reasonably up-to-date computer (less than five years old) that is dedicated for your personal use. If you do not, you still might be able to complete the projects using a   USB flash drive and the computers in Klamath B26 if  GTFs using the classroom for other classes permit you to do so, but it might be a bit inconvenient; please let me know if you have this challenge.</p>
<h4>Basic Proficiency in <strong>System Administration</strong> of Your Personal Computer</h4>
<p>Students in this class are expected to have basic proficiency with one of the three major contemporary operating systems (Unix, Macintosh, or Windows) such that they can, for example, change  system settings to always show file extensions (which should be your default setting), determine if there are  hidden files in a directory, and quickly and easily move files between local directories and server  drives. If you are using a personal computer, this computer should have at least  3 GB of HD space available for this class, and a up-to-date  operating system. You should have basic system administration skills on your system, such as to be able to and install and configure software, and to understand the value of power cycling your computer for maintenance and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Students are expected to maintain secure and reliable backups of all of there coursework such that (a) other students cannot access that data and (b) multiple independent copies are maintained of all important files. Students might consider getting an account using cloud services such as on Google Drive or Dropbox, to keep their files there  as a backup and to be able to work flexibly.  Students are also expected to maintain at least one additional backup of all of their work at all times on an external drive, such as by using Time Machine with an external drive on a Macintosh computer, because many cloud services cause deletions to propagate, and all hard drives including cloud services sometimes fail.</p>
<h4>Basic Proficiency in Python</h4>
<p>Students  are expected to start the class with basic proficiency in Python, including on the topics that will be enumerated for students during the first lecture.  If you lack proficiency in these topics, then you may need to spend some additional time to come up to speed such that you can complete the projects in a timely manner. Please alert me to this situation and I will direct you to appropriate resources and exercises.</p>
<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>There will be five programming projects. The final project will be due during the last week of classes.</p>
<h4> Exams and Quizzes</h4>
<p>There will be a final exam in the time slot allocated on the UO
final exam schedule. There will be a weekly quiz every Monday (except the first day of class). An unexcused absence at an exam or quiz will result in   zero points for that assessment opportunity. There will be no make-up exams or quizzes.</p>
<h4>Course Communication</h4>
<p>Students in this class are expected to check Canvas for announcements daily.  It appears as if you can have these announcements sent to you as email by issuing these command in Canvas:  User Settings / Notifications / Announcement / Notify me right away.</p>
<p>Please email the instructor and GTFs with any questions and concerns regarding the class. Please following these  guidelines when doing so:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Follow the UO Information Services <a href="http://it.uoregon.edu/node/229">netiquette
  guidelines</a>.</li>
  <li>Check your @uoregon.edu email accounts daily, consistent with the <a href="http://registrar.uoregon.edu/current_students/email_policy">Registrar's email policy</a>.</li>
  <li>Send all course-related emails from your UO email accounts, also consistent with the <a href="http://registrar.uoregon.edu/current_students/email_policy">Registrar's email policy</a>. You should also email from your UO email accounts to clearly distinguish your email from spam.</li>
  <li> If necessary, you can<a href="http://cc.uoregon.edu/mailforward.html"> forward
    your uoregon email</a>. </li>
  <li>Configure your email client so that  your first and last name appear in the "From:"
    header. Send an email to yourself and
    make sure your full name (such as "Anthony Hornof") appears in the "From:" header.</li>
  <li>In the subject line of your emails, include "CIS 211"  and describe the  topic in a few words.</li>
  <li>Keep signature files to a minimum.</li>
</ul>
Students have the responsibility to communicate with the instructor about any questions, concerns, or problems that they have during the course. These might relate to any aspect of the class including lectures, group dynamics, communication breakdowns, or anything. Please visit the instructor during his office hours or set up an appointment to discuss any problem or concerns.
<h2>Grades</h2>
<h4>Assessment Units</h4>

<p>Grades will be determined based on your performance on the following assessment units: projects, exams, and quizzes.</p>
<p>Your final grade will be weighted across the assessment units as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Five Projects 40% (with each project equally weighted)<br>
    Midterm: 20%<br>
    Final Exam: 30%<br>
    In-Class Quizzes: 10%<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Evaluation Criteria </h4>
<p>Projects will be assessed against a  set of evaluation criteria that will be made available with each project. Read these criteria carefully because they reflect the aspects of the projects that are important given the pedagogical goals of the class.</p>
<h4>Each Project or Exam Will be Graded to a Numerical Criterion that is set for that Project or Exam</h4>
<p>The course will be graded in a manner that does not limit the number of good grades (such as As and Bs) that will be awarded, and may result in nobody getting a bad grade (such as a D or an F). You will be graded based on the extent to which you have mastered the material that is assessed in each project or exam, but the highest possible level of mastery for each project and exam will be determined by the top 10% of the overall scores that students receive for that project or exam. For example, if the top ten scores on an exam in a class of 100 students average to 80%, then the numerical criterion will be set at 80%. And the scores for all students in the class for that project will be scaled up as if 80% correct counted as 100% correct. If you scored a 76%, your score will be scaled up to a 95%  (76 / 80 = 95), and you got an A on that exam. The scaling will be assigned to each assessment unit in the class, with a separate numerical criterion determined for each unit.</p>
<p>After scores are scaled up,  letter grades will be assigned as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>90% and higher = A<br>
    80-89.9% = B<br>
    65-79.9% = C<br>
    50-64.9% = D<br>
  49.9 and below = F</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Late Assignments and Grading Discrepancies</h4>
<p>Projects submitted late will be subjected to a full letter grade penalty (10% after the score is scaled up).&nbsp; Assignments will be accepted no more than 48 hours  past the due date and time.&nbsp; Exceptions will only be considered if the request is submitted before the due date. Any grading discrepancies (such as a miscounting of points on an
  assignment) must be resolved within a week after the assignment is
returned.</p>
<h2>Course Policies </h2>
<h4>Diversity Welcome</h4>
<p>The modern technology workplace is diverse, international, and
  intercultural. This course welcomes and values
  these differences as an opportunity to increase our awareness of  the contemporary global society, how
to work better in groups, and how to build better computer systems.</p>
<h4>Students with Disabilities</h4>

<p>If you have a documented disability and anticipate needing
accommodation in this course, please start the process by providing me with your letter of accommodation  from the <a href="http://aec.uoregon.edu/">UO Accessible Education Center</a> during the first week of classes.</p>
<h4>Academic Honesty</h4>
<p>Students who  are found to have committed an academically dishonest act in this course will receive an F for the course.</p>
<p>Academic <em>honesty</em> includes the following. You <em>should</em> do all of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clearly list each person and his or her contribution to any project or exam. Include this information in all  documents that are submitted, and in the header of all affected source code files. The contributor might be a tutor, roommate, officemate, fellow student, or any other person that contributed in any way to your work.</li>
  <li>Clearly identify and delimit any content (such as written text, computer code, photographs, videos, and sounds) that are derived from another source, published or unpublished, with the original source and author indicated very clearly in the computer code, user interface, and  documents.</li>
  <li>Protect your own work and insure that other students cannot obtain and use your solutions without attribution. Do not put your solutions on a web site with no password protection, even if no other pages point to this web page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Academic <em>dishonesty</em> includes the following. You should <em>not</em> do any of the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Misrepresent someone else's work, including anything you find
    on the web, as your own work, or in any way contributing to such a
    misrepresentation.</li>
  <li>Submit someone
    else's work as your own without indicating the source.</li>
  <li>Knowingly or accidentally
    make your work available to another student such that they can submit your work
    as their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>All evidence of academic dishonesty will be  pursued consistent with the UO <a href="https://uodos.uoregon.edu/StudentConductandCommunityStandards/AcademicMisconduct/AddressingAcademicMisconduct/tabid/249/Default.aspx">Step-by-step guide for addressing academic misconduct</a>.</p>
<h4>Changes to the Syllabus</h4>
<p>Students will be notified in writing of any changes to the syllabus.</p>
