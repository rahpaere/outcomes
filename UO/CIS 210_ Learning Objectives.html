  <h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
  <p>The primary objective of this course is to introduce the basic
  concepts and practices of computer science. The core ideas of
  computer programming will be explored using the Python 
  programming language. We will cover fundamental approaches to
  problem solving and the creation of software solutions as well as
  introduce basic computational concepts
  </p>
  <p>Computer science students will gain a foundation for further
  study if computer science, including a more in-depth treatment of
  object-oriented programming in CIS 211. Students in other majors
  will find rich connections from computational concepts to many
  fields. Learning to program is also an excellent way to build and
  exercise problem solving skills and gain access to a powerful problem solving tool.
  </p>

<div class="item">
<h2>Understand ...</h2>
  <h3>Sequential execution model</h3>
  <p>Have a reasonably accurate, useful mental model of program
  state, including local variables in the stack and references to
  values in the heap. Understand the difference between a name, a variable, a
  memory cell, and the value stored in a memory cell.  Understand how
  two variables could refer to the same memory cell (aliasing), and
  how two variables could have the same name (in different
  scopes).</p>
  <p>Understand program execution as a series of modifications to
  program state. Be able to sketch the effect of simple program
  statements, and to accurately predict the effect of a sequence of
  program statements.</p>

  <h3 class="sub">Demonstrated by .. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Construction of projects</li>
    <li>Exam questions that require predicting the effect of
    code.
    </li>
  </ul>
  

  <h3>Control Flow</h3>
  <p>Operationally understand conditional control flow, including nested
  conditionals, short-circuit evaluation, and sequential composition
  of conditional statements.  Be able to accurately predict the
  effect of program fragments including conditionals.</p>
  <p>Operationally understand loops, including loops over
  aggregate data structures (“for each X in S”), while
  loops, and for loops.</p>
  <p>Have a basic problem-solving vocabulary of loop patterns
  involving aggregate data types, including summarizing (summing,
  counting, etc.), filtering, and sequential search.  Be able to
  choose an appropriate loop pattern to solve basic programming
  problems. </p>
  <p>Be able to design and implement control flow involving nested
  loops and conditional execution.</p>
  <p>Be able to design inductive (recursive) loops, explicitly identifying
  base cases and progress cases, and reason about termination.  
  <!--In
  particular, understand binary search as a basic loop pattern, and be
  able to design and implement a binary search and reason about its
  correctness.--> </p>


  <h3 class="sub">Demonstrated by .. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Construction of projects that require design of loops,
        including binary search and non-trivial loops</li>
    <li>Exam questions that require predicting the effect of
	idiomatic loops, and composition of idiomatic and more
	challenging loops. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Procedural Abstraction</h3>
  <p>Have a reasonably accurate, useful mental model of the effects of
  program call and return on program state.  Understand how a
  procedure call creates a new activation record containing local
  variables, how parameters are passed to procedures, and how
  procedure return discards the activation record.</p>
  <p>Understand parameter passing both from a programming perspective
  (e.g., copying actuals into formals by position rather than name)
  and at a more detailed operational level (e.g., how passing a
  reference type by value has the effect of aliasing).  Be able to
  accurately predict the effects of program sequences involving
  procedure call and return.  Understand that modifications to the
  heap persist beyond procedure return, while modifications to
  procedure-local variables don't.</p>
  <p>Understand the difference between local and global variables, and
  be able to predict the effect of modifications to either.</p>
  <p>Understand procedural abstraction as a design tactic to break
   larger problems into brain-size chunks.  Understand that some
   decompositions into procedures are better than others, and begin to
  develop some skill in making good decomposition decisions.</p>
  <p>Understand that procedures can call other procedures, and be able
  to design programs with multiple levels of procedure calls.</p>

  
  <h3 class="sub">Demonstrated by .. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Completing projects that require breaking a complex problem down into
  multiple functions.</li> 
  <li>Exam questions that require predicting the effect of multiple
  levels of function calls with arguments that may or may not
  share references. 
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
  <p>Understand that testing is part of programming, and can be
  systematic rather than haphazard.  </p>
  <p>Understand that debugging is part of programming, and can be
  systematic rather than haphazard.</p>

  <h3 class="sub">Demonstrated by .. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Completing projects of sufficient complexity that debugging will 
    almost certainly be required during development. 
    </li>
  </ul>


	<h3>Programming Style</h3>
	<p>Understand that design is part of programming, and can be systematic rather than haphazard</p>
	<p>Ability to design and write code that reflects awareness of standard design techniques, good programming style, Python style standards, and supports testing.</p>
	
	<h3 class="sub">Demonstrated by .. </h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Completing projects according to class design and programming style specifications.
	</li>
	</ul>

  <h3>Representation and Interpretation</h3>
  <p>Understand that the same memory representation (bit pattern) may
  be interpreted in different ways.  Understand the notion
  <em>type</em> as indicating the intended interpretation and
  potential operations on a value in memory. Understand why the
  string “1” is different from the integer 1 and from the
  floating point value 1.0. </p>
  <p>Understand the difference between numbers and computer representations of
  numbers.  Understand that computer operations like addition and
  division do not obey all the familiar mathematical properties of
  real numbers, because they operate on computer representations
  rather than actual numbers.</p>


  <h3 class="sub">Demonstrated by .. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Exam questions that require predicting the effect of
    code manipulating numbers, strings, and other objects.
    </li>
  </ul>



  <h3>Computational Complexity</h3>
  <p>Understand, at a basic level, how to reason about the
  relation between the number of computational steps and problem
  size (time and space). <!--Distinguish linear-time from quadratic algorithms, and
  as a special case understand why binary search executes
  logarithmic time.  We will not study asymptotic complexity in
  depth, prepare detailed proofs of program complexity, or introduce
  big-O notation, but we
  will introduce and apply the basic concept of assessing complexity
  and choosing algorithms that are more efficient than alternatives.--></p>


  <h3 class="sub">Demonstrated by .. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Exam questions that require composing algorithms 
        that executes within a given complexity bound (typically
        linear time). 
    </li>
  </ul>
  
<!--
  <h3>Object-oriented Programming</h3>
  <p>Have a basic but accurate operational model of classes and
  objects.</p>
  <p>Understand the difference between a variable local to a method,
  a field local to an object, and a class.</p>

<h3 class="sub">Demonstrated by .. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Completing projects that require writing and using classes and
  objects. </li> 
  <li>Exam questions that require predicting the effect of a series of
  method calls on multiple objects. 
    </li>
  </ul>
